If there was a Cybernetician that played by his own rules, Stafford Beer was that man.

A typical flow may be anachronistic to a monolith architecture, where by, the Viable System Model is closer in nature to a [microservices](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) architecture.

A viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment.

Beer developed his branch of Cybernetics focused on business and governments. He was obsessed with how information flows through these institutions. How to better manage those processes and in turn make them more resilient, efficient and adaptable.

This culminated in his crowning achievement [Project Cybersyn](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn). A visionary project that shares many similarities today in data and distributed systems (complete with whiskey holders in the chairs, Beers' tipple of choice).
