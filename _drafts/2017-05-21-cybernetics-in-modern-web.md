Popularised by the American Mathematician and Philosopher [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) in 1948, the interdisciplinary field of Cybernetics[^1] defines itself as:

**The study of systems, such as mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and social systems**.

Cyberneticians view the world through the flow of information, communication channels and its organisation. Generally it is applied when the system incorporates a closed signalling loop. In essence, where action by the system generates some change in its environment, resulting in a change to the system in some manner, triggering a system change. This is sometimes referred to as a "circular causal" relationship.

Cybernetics is only concerned with modelling the systems. It does not care about “how” or “why”.

In [his book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Human-Use-Beings-Cybernetics-Society/0306803208) entitled "The Human Use Of Human Beings:Cybernetics In Modern Society", Norbert Wiener focused on the relationship between message and response as a key element of Cybernetics.

> When I communicate with another person, I impart a message to him, and when he communicates back with me he returns a related message which contains information primarily accessible to him and not to me… When I give an order to a machine, the situation is not essentially different from that which arises when I give an order to a person. In other words, as far as my consciousness goes I am aware of the order that has gone out and of the signal of compliance that has come back. To me personally, the fact that the signal in its intermediate stages has gone through a machine rather than through a person is irrelevant and does not in any case greatly change my relation to the signal. Thus the theory of control in engineering, whether human or animal or mechanical, is a chapter in the theory of messages.” [^2]

Such an overarching field as Cybernetics encompasses many areas. Primarily in our field of designing usable systems we are most concerned with the modelling of messaging within Cybernetics. Let us study some examples below and put the theory in to practice.

The most basic example of a circular causal relationship is a thermostat. The thermostat has one purpose; to maintain its temperature at a pre-determined setting. When an external influence alters the temperature of the room the thermostat will either turn on and increase the temperature or turn off to reduce the temperature until it’s predetermined setting is achieved.

The result after output from the controlling system is fed back into the controller, informing its next action. This behaviour endlessly loops checking if the thermostat value is not correct and applying its logic in an inversely proportional manner to readdress the balance.

This basic behaviour is called a “closed signalling loop” and is the foundation for many cybernetic models.
