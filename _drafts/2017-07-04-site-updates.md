 Squashed CSS down to 1.5kb (Gzipped). Could be decreased further by removing the code that styles generated HTML from Jekyll by adding a custom renderer. Not sure if it's worth the effort!
Implemented CSS grid, technology is good but needs the ability to ignore divs. Trying to write 'correct' markup *and* write a grid that works in the way you want can be problematic.

Average HTML file size squashed by using less markup with CSS grid down to 4kb (Gzipped).
