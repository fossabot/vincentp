Hello, I'm a UI/UX and Node specialist focusing on large scale complex systems for well know big brands.

I provide consultation, support and coding for all parts of a website to interface via an API. User Interface design, human interaction design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

For the last 16 years I have been crafting websites and applications, where my client roster has included clients such as: GOV.UK, Capita, BBC, EE, NHS, The Vatican, Microsoft, General Motors, Channel 5 and giffgaff.

I am also a contributor to various open source projects including [Mozlla Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) and [GOV UK](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/).
