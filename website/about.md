For the last 14 years I have been making websites and applications, where my client roster has included clients such as: The BBC, EE, The NHS, Orange, The Vatican, General Motors, Channel 5 and giffgaff.
I have also helped new businesses grow; creating websites and designs for smaller companies to help them make that first important step.
