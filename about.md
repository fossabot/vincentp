## About

During my career I have been incredibly fortunate to work on a diverse range of products and services :

- E-learning products and solutions
- Enterprise healthcare applications
- Worldwide marketing campaigns
- Virtual reality
- Sites for major brands and start-ups.
- [A global social media platform](http://www.xt3.com)
- [Computer games](http://uk.playstation.com/tag)

I love a challenge or complex problems to solve. Tailoring solutions specifically to your business needs and skill levels. An expert at breaking down complex problems, explaining them in simple language. I can help you get to the root of a problem and communicate with all parts of your business what is happening.
