Hello, I'm Vincent Pickering a Consultant Front-end Architect and Developer with over 17 years experience working across an incredible breadth of industries and complex technologies.

## About

During my career I have been incredibly fortunate to work on a diverse range of products and services, from cutting edge e-learning products and solutions, to enterprise healthcare applications, worldwide marketing campaigns, virtual reality, a [global social media platform](http://www.xt3.com), [computer games, software](http://uk.playstation.com/tag), countless websites and much more.

I love a challenge or complex problems to solve, and tailor solutions specifically to your business needs and skill levels. An expert at breaking down complex problems and explaining them in simple language I can help you get to the root of a problem and communicate with all parts of your business what is happening.
