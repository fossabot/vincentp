## Frontend Consultancy and Code Reviews

I believe good consultancy happens face to face on site.  I will speak with project stakeholders building a clear picture of the problem(s) or issues that your team face.

Working with the team to aid in training and code support. I can help skill up your team and work with them to tailor code solutions and approaches that suit the unique needs to your business.

Consultancy work is specific to the client and project. Consider a retainer for periodic code reviews or extra training after the main engagement. Apply the renewed momentum and application of skills you have achieved.
